# Procedural Building Generation

## Full Submission

-> Still needs to write readme

### Improvement

Features that I still want to improve on:
 - Improve visuals on rocks to look more realistic
 - physics on plants: have them shake when golem steps
 - optimization

## Submission 2

Created the basic shape of the structure. Added a fully functioning building generation tool with border, pillars, simple assets and support. there are toggles for border and pillar decorations and it also supports different sided polygons for every floor.
